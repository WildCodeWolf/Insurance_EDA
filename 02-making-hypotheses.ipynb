    "## Five Questions, Ten Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the information now we can come up with few initial\n",
    "hypotheses to verify going forward.  All of them will be bivariate\n",
    "in nature, like \"Is there a correlation between X and Y?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Is there a relation between the age and the insurance charges?<br/>\n",
    "    Given that the overall health declines with growing age, one would\n",
    "    expect to see higher costs for older people.\n",
    "    - *Null hypothesis*:  There is a relation between the age and the\n",
    "      insurance charges.\n",
    "    - *Alternative hypothesis*:  There is no relation between the age\n",
    "      and the insurance charges.\n",
    "2.  Do males and females get charged evenly by their insurance companies?<br/>\n",
    "    Given the fact that medical treatment for both sexes varies significantly,\n",
    "    one would expect females to be charged more on average.\n",
    "    - *Null hypothesis*:  Females cause higher charges on average than males.\n",
    "    - Alternative hypothesis:  Females do not cause higher charges on average.\n",
    "3.  Is there a relation between the BMI and the insurance charges?<br/>\n",
    "    The BMI can indicate the overall physical health and nutrition quality\n",
    "    and is affected by many different factors.  One could, however, expect\n",
    "    that a BMI outside of the respective accepted healthy range for males\n",
    "    and females would indicate a lower health level and thus cause higher\n",
    "    insurance charges.\n",
    "    - *Null hypothesis*:  There is a relation between the BMI and the charges.\n",
    "    - *Alternative hypothesis*:  There is no relation between the BMI and\n",
    "      the charges.\n",
    "4.  Does the number of children affect the insurance charges?<br/>\n",
    "    Having children can have many effects: some people become less\n",
    "    susceptible to taking risks, they improve their own lifestyle to\n",
    "    be an example for and take care of their children. On the other hand\n",
    "    side, tending to children can cause additional stress or warrant\n",
    "    risks in and of itself.\n",
    "    - *Null hypothesis*:  There is an influence of the number of children on\n",
    "      the charges.\n",
    "    - *Alternative hypothesis*:  There is no influence of the number of\n",
    "      children on the charges.\n",
    "5.  Is there a relation between the smoking habits and the insurance charges?<br/>\n",
    "    Smoking is known to worsen one's health in general, so one would\n",
    "    expect to see higher charges for smokers.\n",
    "    - *Null hypothesis*:  There is an influence of the smoking habits\n",
    "      on the charges.\n",
    "    - *Alternative hypothesis*:  There is no influence of the smoking habits\n",
    "      on the charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many, many more questions could be asked just by looking at the naming\n",
    "of the columns and the descriptive statistics.  Following are a few more\n",
    "to give some examples:\n",
    "-  Is there a relation between the region and the insurance charges?\n",
    "    - This would indicate that there might be regional risk factors\n",
    "      the insurance companies would need to account for.\n",
    "-  Is there a preferred region for younger or older people.\n",
    "    - This could correlate to, for instance, job availability, education\n",
    "      and general working conditions.\n",
    "-  Is there a relation between the BMI and the region?\n",
    "    - This could indicate differences in lifestyles and qualities of life,\n",
    "      nutrition and social interaction.\n",
    "-  Is there a relation between the number of children and the region?\n",
    "    - This could indicate that there might be a preferred region for\n",
    "      family life.\n",
    "-  Is there a relation between the region and the smoking habits?\n",
    "    - This could, again, hint towards correlations between the\n",
    "      respective regions and the local lifestyle, quality of life,\n",
    "      overall stress, presence and availability of tobacco and so on.\n",
    "-  Is there a tendency for one sex towards developing smoking habits\n",
    "   more so than the other?\n",
    "    - Developing smoking habits is the result of many different factors.\n",
    "      While there might be a tendency to one's sex at some point, it will\n",
    "      probably not be of major influence.\n",
    "-  Do smoking habits affect the BMI?\n",
    "    - Since both are tightly related to one's health, one might expect to\n",
    "      see a connection here.\n",
    "-  How does the age play into smoking habits?\n",
    "    - Knowing that the consumption of tobacco creates an addiction, one\n",
    "      might expect to see a that older people tend to smoke more than younger\n",
    "      ones; once having developed the addiction, it's less likely to get\n",
    "      rid of it again.\n",
    "-  Does the number of children affect the smoking habits?\n",
    "    - Assuming that smoking ties into the overall perceived stress level,\n",
    "      having to tend to children might increase the chance for that.\n",
    "-  Does the number of children affect the BMI?\n",
    "    - Again, this ties into the question asked earlier relating family\n",
    "      life to one's overall health (question 4).\n",
    "-  Is there a relation between the age and the number of children?\n",
    "    - Assuming that having children at all indicates the decision to\n",
    "      settle down and having achieved some sort of goals in life, there\n",
    "      might be a hint towards children coming into one's life at a later\n",
    "      stage.  On the other hand side, factors like religion, social status\n",
    "      and wealth and others could encourage having children at a younger\n",
    "      age as well.\n",
    "-  Is there a relation between the sex and the number of children?\n",
    "    - A difference could indicate variations in the predominant family (or\n",
    "      relationship) model, or could be caused by mortalities not tracked in\n",
    "      the dataset.\n",
    "-  Is there a relation between the age and the BMI?\n",
    "    - This is to be expected to be true when taking children into account\n",
    "      as well.  But the records of the dataset start at age 18, meaning\n",
    "      we're missing a crucial set of information to come to a conclusion here.\n",
    "-  Is there a relation between the sex and the BMI?\n",
    "    - This is known to be true, and thus we shall expect to find evidence in\n",
    "      the dataset as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall not look deeper into those, however.  The initial five questions\n",
    "will serve as a guideline for further inspections as otherwise the scope\n",
    "of the exercise would extend beyond its original intent.\n",
